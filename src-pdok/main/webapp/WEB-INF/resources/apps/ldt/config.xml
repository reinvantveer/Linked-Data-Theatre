    DESCRIPTION
    Default theatre configuration. This consists of:
	- The configuration of stages;
	- The declaration of roles;
	- A placeholder for some context parameters (which will be filled at run-time)
 
	You should configure config.xml to your local settings:
	- env: the environment (prod, test, dev). Only in dev will runtime errors be visible. Default = prod
    - configuration-endpoint: the SPARQL endpoint which contains the configurations of the Linked Data Theatre
    - local-endpoint: the SPARQL endpoint that is used as the default endpoint to fetch data
    - the tempdir, if any: the absolute path to the directory to be used by the linked data theatre for temporary files (default is the tomcat temp dir)
	- sparql: states if a public sparql endpoint should be available at /sparql. "yes" means: make a public endpoint available.
    - the <site> node contains the configuration for every domainname that is served by the LDT
      - domain: the domainname for this configuration
  	  - icon: (optional) the favicon.ico that is visible for this domain
	  - css: (optional) an alternative css stylesheet for this domain
	  - site-endpoint: (optional): the SPARQL endpoint that is used as the default endpoint to fetch date (overrides the theatre setting)
	  - docroot: (optional): use a docroot, if the LDT is not installed in the tomcat ROOT and is only serving a subdirectory
			(for example: http://mydomain.org/linkeddatatheatre/...)
			When using the docroot, all URI's will be made relative to this docroot and not the root itself
	  - backstage: (optional) the domainname of the backstage, if the backstage domain is different from the stage domain
	    (for example: a backstage behind a VPN). Make sure that a backstage domain is not a regular site domain!
	  - the <stage> node contains the configuration for every stage within the specific domain. At least one stage should be present.
		- name: (optional) the name of the stage
		- backstage-role: (optional) the role for anybody that can enter the backstage (to update or view the stage configuration)
	- the <endpoint> node(s) contain extra information uses for sparql-endpoint, currently only for basic-authentication:
		- username: the username for the endpoint
		- password: the password for the endpoint

	For every stage, a named graph contains the detailed LDT configuration (the script of the production that is performed on the stage).
	The URI for the named graph is created from the domain name and the stage name:
		http://{domain}/stage/{stage name}
	If a stage doesn't have a name, the URI for the named graph is created from the domain name only:
		http://{domain}/stage
	If you need more than one stage for a single site, you should use the name attribute to differentiate between stages.
		
	A user with the backstage-role can look into the stage configuration using the following URL:
		http://{domain}/backstage/{stage name}
